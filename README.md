    - made Gcode  G0x instead of only Gx acceptable,  discarded all  Gcode starting with M, discarded Gcode starting with '('and '%' which are comments
    - mapped G2 and G3 onto G1 , accepting I J K values but not using them ... did not check the actual effect on rounded corners.

Yagv-ng was tested under
  
  - Linux, Ubuntu 20.04  and MINT 20  (Ulyana)

  - Windows 7

## Installation

Right now, yagv-ng does not require an installation.  
If Python and pyglet are installed, it can be run from any directory by
just executing "yagv-ng".
  
Notice that there aren't any dialogs for opening and loading files, hence  
yagv-ng should be executed from a command line, inside a terminal:
  
    ./yagv-ng yourfilename.gcode
    
    
### Linux

Python, as well as pyglet should be available via your distribution's
package management system.
